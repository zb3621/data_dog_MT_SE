#Prerequisites

First i tried using the docker approach and see if i can use that tool to do this project. Since i partitoned my mac into windows and having installed a virtual machine prior in one of my classes in college so i decided to install ubuntu version 5.12

+## Collecting Metrics: 


 
+ 


 
+* Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog. 


 
+* Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database. 


 
+* Create a custom Agent check that submits a metric named my_metric with a random value between 0 and 1000. 


 
+* Change your check's collection interval so that it only submits the metric once every 45 seconds. 


 
+* **Bonus Question** Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?
